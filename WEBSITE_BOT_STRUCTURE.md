## 🚫 What NOT to Do

**DO NOT:**
1. ❌ Create channels that already exist in other categories
2. ❌ Duplicate content from Grizzly Bot channels
3. ❌ Add content about Grizzly Bot (that's handled in category #4)

## 🎯 Integration Best Practices

1. **Stay In Your Lane**: Only populate Website Bot channels
2. **No Overlap**: Don't duplicate Grizzly Bot features/content
3. **Clear Separation**: Make it obvious this is for website operations
4. **Reference GCC Structure**: Link to other channels when appropriate (e.g., "For Grizzly Bot support, see <#open-a-ticket>")
5. **Maintain Permissions**: Don't modify permission settings (already configured)

## ⚠️ Important Reminders

1. **Grizzly Bot handles ALL Grizzly Bot channels** - Don't interfere
2. **Website Bot only manages the "🌐 Website Bot" category**
3. **GCC is NOT a DayZ server** - It's the bot's headquarters
4. **All website bot channels are Bronze+** - No tier-gating within your category
5. **DO NOT create duplicate channels** - Work within your 3 existing channels

---

**Summary**: Your job is to manage website-related features in your 3 designated channels. Don't touch anything else in GCC. Stay focused on server listings and website operations.
